# ArrayStack Implementation in Java

This project contains an implementation of a stack data structure using an array in Java. The stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, allowing elements to be pushed and popped in a specific order.

## Features

- **push()**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **pop()**: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
- **top()**: Peek at the top element without removing it.
- **size()**: Get the current number of elements in the stack.
- **isEmpty()**: Check if the stack is empty.
- **isFull()**: Check if the stack has reached its capacity.

## Files Included

- `ArrayStack.java`: Implementation of the stack data structure.
- `Stack.java`: Interface defining the stack operations.
- `StackEmptyException.java`: Custom exception for stack underflow.
- `StackFullException.java`: Custom exception for stack overflow.
